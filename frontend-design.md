# Frontend Design Guidelines

This file guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work — the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography
Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter. Opt for distinctive choices that elevate aesthetics — unexpected, characterful font pairs. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.

### Color & Theme
Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.

### Motion
Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.

### Spatial Composition
Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

## Hard Rules

NEVER use:
- Overused font families: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts, Space Grotesk
- Cliched color schemes (especially purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and cookie-cutter component patterns
- Generic AI-generated aesthetics that lack context-specific character

Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics across projects. No two designs should look the same.

Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:
- Maximalist designs → elaborate code, extensive animations, layered effects
- Minimalist designs → restraint, precision, careful spacing and typography

Interpret creatively. Make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Don't hold back — commit fully to a distinctive vision.
